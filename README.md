# OpenFundPlatform üåçüí°
A crowdfunding platform built using Django and React, designed to allow users to create, manage, and support project campaigns.
Overview
OpenFundPlatform is a web application that enables users to register, log in, and manage crowdfunding campaigns. The backend is powered by Django and Django REST Framework, with PostgreSQL as the database. The frontend is built with React.js, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is used for secure authentication. The platform supports RESTful JSON APIs for communication between the frontend and backend.
